## üì¶ Install

To install the component library itself

```bash
yarn add suomifi-ui-components
```

Include **required** styles from `dist/main.css` as best suited for your project. You can, for example, import the stylesheet to your app and let your bundler handle it:

```typescript
import 'suomifi-ui-components/dist/main.css';
```

This stylesheet contains part of the global styles for the library and Reach UI peer dependency styles.

Include **required** fonts as best suited for your project. You can, for example, use the following import with your global css.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,400,600&display=swap');
```

The following fonts and variants are required: Font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Font-weight: 300, 400, 600

### Peer dependencies

You should also install the following peer dependencies.

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) version >=16.8.0 and related dependencies and typings.
- [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) version >=5.2.1 and related dependencies and typings.

- The aim is to keep dependencies up to date and use the latest available versions. We encourage you to use the latest available versions of peer dependencies.

```bash
yarn add styled-components
```

- If using TypeScript, version 3.8 or above is required.

- In case TypeScript is used and skipLibCheck compiler option is set to false, also typings for [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react), [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom), [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/styled-components/) and [warning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/warning) are required.

```bash
yarn add @types/styled-components @types/warning
```

## üî® Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from 'suomifi-ui-components';
ReactDOM.render(<Button />, mountNode);
```

### üåä Component variants

Components have variant-property for different versions of the current component. Some components might also have static variants e.g. `Component.variant`, but using these is discouraged as they are being removed in future releases.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'suomifi-ui-components';
<Button variant=‚Äùsecondary‚Äù>This is a seconday button</Button>;
```

### ‚õ± Extending styles

Components' styles can be customized with [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) / [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion):

```javascript
styled(Button)...
```

_HOX!!! If you use Styled Components you cannot use Component.variant (static methods) and you need to use variant-property to get variants from the styled(Component)._ Partly for this reason we are getting rid of the static variants in the future releases.

**or** using CSS-ClassName:

```jsx
<Button className="button--custom">Example</Button>
```

```css
.fi-button.button--custom {
  ...;
}
```

Don't use ~~!important~~, if really really needed - for specificity hack you can define styles using classNames multiple times `.fi-button.button--custom.button--custom {...}`
